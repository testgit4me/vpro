What is containers?
Container is tool , technology which allows to run processes on isolated environment using kernel of host OS.

lets say we have tomcat, nginx servers and we can  isolate these services using VMs, tomcat -> VM, nginx -> VM, 

VM needs OS, licences, big in size not convient for shipment and deployment, support, maintance, expensive, 

to provide high availablity need multiple VMs, so needs additional financial resources

let's imagine that we have munltiple processes running in the same OS but isolated, like VMs which has its own IP/Port numbers, directories but without OSs, this is container.

a container is process running isolated in directory with its own namespce, cgroup, with neccesary bin/lib files in this directory

we can treat a container as standard unit of software that packges up code, its depencies but without OS. one of the benefits of contaianers that it has not OS, so its light weght they just processes, so it is easy for shipment and deployment.

Docker 
- actually manages our containers
- we can call it container run time environment
- we can run containers very easy using docker engine
- actually is name of company who developed docker engine that allows very easy manage containers, Docker engine, it is docker run time environment, docker open source project

PAAS - platform as service, is like beanstalk, we just upload our artifact and run up the service/application.

Docker engine - it is a service, deamon running on OS, we can connect it using rest API or docker cli.

Docker is popular becouse of its images. in its repositoty, available 1000 of images that we can use in our projects or use by custimizing them. we can simply pull the image and run the containers. 

we can connect volumes to save or preserve the data out of the containers. it allows to create many containers without lose of data.

windows or linux, as the process running on container uses host OS kernel, we only can run windows containers on windows OS as the process needs windows kernel, linux containers on linux OSs as it also need linux kernel to be run.

what is OS kernel?
- people confuse with bios and OS
- interface betweem hardware and software applications
- kernel makes software to interact with hardware for the specific work done
- photoshop, hardware components/cpu/memory/isb devices, kernal stands between
what is namespace && cgroup
